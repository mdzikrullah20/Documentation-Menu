        <h3><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-c-programming-language/"> What is C++
                Objects and Class Inheritence Polymorephisem Abstraction Encapsulation</a></h3>
        <p>What is C++?</p>
        <p> C++ is a general purpose programming languages and widely used now a day' for competitive
            programming . It has imperative, object oriented etc,<br>
            C++ is an efficient and powerfull language and find wide in va platforms 3D graphics and
            real-time simulations.Because of the inclusion Because of <br>
            the inclusion of rich function libraries, working in C++
            <br>
            <br>	
            Let us now look at the program :
            <br>
            <br>
            #include <br>
            using namespace std;
            <br>
            int main()
            {
            cout <<"Hello world"; <br>
                return 0;
                <br>
                }
                <br>
                C++ is an Objected Programming Language.
                <br>
                The main pillars of objected Progrmming are:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Object and class</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorephisem</li>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Object and Class</h4>
                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming - As the name suggests use obejects in programming Object-
                    oriented programmking aims to implement real world entiies like <br> inheritece,hiding
                    polymorephism,etc in progrmming ,The main aim OOP si to bind together the data and the
                    function that operater on them so that no other <br> part of code can accsess this data
                    except that functio </p>

                <b>Object</b> : An Object is anidentifiable entity with some charaterstics and behavior,An
                Object is an instance of a class when a class is defined no memory is <br>allocated but when
                it is instantiated (i,e,an object is created) memory is allocated <br>
        </p>
        <b>Class :</b> The building block of C++ that leads to object-Oriented progrmming is a Class Itis a
        user difined data typy , which holds its own data member <br>and member functions,which can be
        accessed & used by creating an instance of that class A class is like a blueprint for an object for
        Example: Consider that class <br> of cars there may br many cars >whith diffrent names and brand but
        all of them wil share some commmon propeties like all of them will have 4 <br>wheels speed Limit
        Milege range etc so here car is the class and wheels speed mileage are
        their properties,</p>

        <p>
            Inheritance
            <br>
            <br>
            The capability of a class to derive properties and characterstics from another class is called
            inheritance. inheritance is one of the most important feature of<br> object oriented programming
            sub class : The class that inherits properties from anothr class is calle sub class or drived
            class .super class : The class whose properties <br>are inheried by sub class is called base
            class or super class using inheritance, we have to write the function only one time instead of
            three times as we have inherited<br> rest of the three class from base class (Vehicle).
        </p>

        <b>Mode of Inheritance :</b>
        <p>
            <b>Public Mode :</b> If we derived a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member
            of the base class will become public in the drived class and<br> propected members of the base
            class will become protected in drived class.
        </p>
        <b>Protectes Mode :</b>
        <p>If we drived a sub class from a protected base class. Then both public member and protected
            members of the base class will become privatein derived class.
        </p>

        <b>Type of Inheritance in C++:</b>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>Single Inheritance:</b> In Single inheritane,a class is allowed to inhrit from only one class
            .i.e one sub class is inheried by one base class only.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Multiple Inheritance:</b> Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit
            from more than one class.i.e one sub class is inherited from more than one base classe.
        </p>
        <div> 
            <p>
            <b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b>In this of inheriance, a derived class is created from another  dreived class
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Hierarical Inheritance :</b> In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inhrited from a single base class i.e.more than one derived class is careated from a single base class.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b> Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combining more than one type of inheritance.For example: Combining Hierarchale inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
              <b>Polymorephisem</b>
             <p>
                The word polymorephiesm means having many from. In simple word, we can define polymorephiesm as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one frm. A real life example of polymorephisem, a person at the same time can have diffrent characterstics Like a man at the same time is a father,husband,an employee. so the same person posses diffrent behavior in diffrent situation. This is called polymorephism is considered as of the important feature of object oriented programming.
                <br>
                <b>In C++ polymorephisem is mainly divided into two type:</b>
                <br>
                1. Compile time Polymorphism
                <br>
                2. Runtime Polymorphism
                <br>
                <br>
                ompiler time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or
                operator overloading.
                Runtime polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding.
             </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Abstraction</b>
            <br>
            <p>
                Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented
                programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the
                details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the
                outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
                Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the
                accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not
                know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about
                the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is
                what abstraction is.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Abstraction using Class :</b>We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. Class helps us
                to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can
                decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
                Abstraction in Header files: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For
                example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to
                calculate power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file
                and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to
                which the function is actually calculating power of numbers.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:</b>
                 <br>
                 1.Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code.
                 <br>
                 2.Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
                 <br>
                 3.Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user.
                 <br>
                 4.Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided
                 to the user

        <div>
            <b>Encapsulation :</b>
            <p>In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single
                unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and
                the functions that manipulates them. Consider a real life example of encapsulation, in a company
                there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The
                finance section handles all the financial transactions and keep records of all the data related to
                finance. Similarly the sales section handles all the sales related activities and keep records of all
                the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from finance section
                needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly
                access the data of sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales
                section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the
                data of sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single
                name “sales section”.
                Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides the data.
                In the above example the data of any of the section like sales, finance or accounts is hidden from
                any other section.
